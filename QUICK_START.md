## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Server won't start
```bash
# Solution 1: Check port conflict
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Solution 2: Kill existing process on port 5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Solution 3: Try different port
# Edit Backend/app.py, change: app.run(port=5001, ...)
```

### Issue: "Connection refused" error
```
✅ Verify server is running: Should see "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
✅ Check firewall settings
✅ Try http://localhost:5000 instead of 127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Issue: JSON output shows as raw text
```
✅ This is expected if JSON has formatting issues
✅ Check browser console (F12) for parsing errors
✅ Copy the raw text to a JSON validator
```

### Issue: Shimmer loading never stops
```
✅ LLM is taking time (normal for complex requests)
✅ Wait 30+ seconds - responses typically take 10-30 seconds
✅ Check network tab in F12 for request status
```

### Issue: Buttons (Copy, Export, Save) don't work
```
✅ Make sure you're not on HTTP (should be http://localhost:5000)
✅ Try Copy to see browser notification
✅ Export creates JSON file - check Downloads folder
```
